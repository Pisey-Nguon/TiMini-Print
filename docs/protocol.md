# Protocol Guide

Start here if you want to use TiMini-Print from your own code.

This guide is intentionally practical.
It answers one question first:

- how do I print something with the current public API?

Read it in this order:

1. get or create a `PrinterDevice`
2. build a `ProtocolJob`
3. send that job through a connector

If you want package boundaries and internal placement after that, read [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## The core objects

### `PrinterDevice`
`PrinterDevice` is the central runtime object.
It carries the resolved:
- profile
- protocol family
- image pipeline
- runtime metadata
- optional transport target

A `PrinterDevice` is the one object that both protocol code and transport code agree on.

### `PrintJobBuilder`
`PrintJobBuilder(device, settings=...)` is the normal high-level entry point.
Use it when you start from a file such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, or `.txt`.

It handles:
- file loading
- page transforms
- rasterization
- protocol job building

### `PrinterProtocol`
`PrinterProtocol(device)` is the lower-level protocol entry point.
Use it only when you already have raster data and want to build a printable job directly.

### `ProtocolJob`
A `ProtocolJob` is what transport sends.
It contains:
- `payload: bytes`
- `runtime_controller`, for families that need session behavior during transport

### Connectors
Connectors handle actual I/O.
The repo provides:
- `BleakBluetoothConnector`
- `SerialConnector`

A connector accepts a `PrinterDevice`, opens a connection, and sends a `ProtocolJob`.

## First example: print a file over Bluetooth

This is the best first contact with the API.

```python
from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog
from timiniprint.printing import PrintJobBuilder, PrintSettings
from timiniprint.transport.bluetooth import BluetoothDiscovery, BleakBluetoothConnector

catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()
discovery = BluetoothDiscovery(catalog)

# Scan nearby supported printers and pick the first one.
devices = await discovery.scan_devices()
if not devices:
    raise RuntimeError("No supported printers found")
device = devices[0]

# Build a printable job from a file.
job = PrintJobBuilder(
    device,
    settings=PrintSettings(
        blackening=3,
        rotate_90_clockwise=False,
    ),
).build_from_file("example.png")

# Open a connection and send the job.
connection = await BleakBluetoothConnector().connect(device)
try:
    await connection.send(job)
finally:
    await connection.disconnect()
```

What this does:
- `BluetoothDiscovery` finds reachable printers and returns `PrinterDevice` objects
- `PrintJobBuilder` turns the file into a `ProtocolJob`
- `BleakBluetoothConnector` uses `device.transport_target` and `device.profile.stream`
- the caller does not manually pass `chunk_size`, `delay_ms`, or `runtime_controller`

Use this path when:
- you want the repo file pipeline
- you are printing normal files, not prebuilt raster data
- you are fine using the repo Bluetooth transport

## Choosing a specific Bluetooth printer

The first example used `scan_devices()` and picked `devices[0]` to avoid introducing a fake or magic printer name.

If you want to select one specific discovered printer, use:

```python
device = await discovery.resolve_device("AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01")
```

or:

```python
device = await discovery.resolve_device("X6H-ABCD")
```

`resolve_device(...)` in `BluetoothDiscovery` means:
- scan for real Bluetooth devices
- pick one discovered device by name or address

It is different from `catalog.detect_device(...)`, which does not scan Bluetooth at all.

## Known profile, no discovery

Use this when Bluetooth discovery is not involved and you already know what printer profile should be used.

```python
from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog, SerialTarget
from timiniprint.printing import PrintJobBuilder
from timiniprint.transport.serial import SerialConnector

catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()

# Create a PrinterDevice directly from a known profile.
device = catalog.device_from_profile(
    "a200",
    transport_target=SerialTarget("/dev/rfcomm0"),
)

job = PrintJobBuilder(device).build_from_file("example.pdf")

connection = await SerialConnector().connect(device)
try:
    await connection.send(job)
finally:
    await connection.disconnect()
```

Use this path when:
- you already know the profile key
- discovery is not part of your flow
- you want an explicit `PrinterDevice` up front

## Use the protocol with your own connector

This is the main extension point if you do not want to use the repo Bluetooth implementation.

A custom connector is expected to do three things:
- connect using a `PrinterDevice`
- send a `ProtocolJob`
- disconnect cleanly

A minimal sketch looks like this:

```python
from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog
from timiniprint.printing import PrintJobBuilder


class MyConnection:
    def __init__(self, raw_link, device):
        self._raw_link = raw_link
        self._device = device

    async def send(self, job):
        # Use the stream tuning resolved for this device.
        chunk_size = self._device.profile.stream.chunk_size
        delay_ms = self._device.profile.stream.delay_ms

        # Your transport implementation is responsible for writing job.payload.
        # If the target family needs session logic, job.runtime_controller must be
        # honored during the write loop.
        await send_payload_over_my_link(
            self._raw_link,
            payload=job.payload,
            chunk_size=chunk_size,
            delay_ms=delay_ms,
            runtime_controller=job.runtime_controller,
        )

    async def disconnect(self):
        await self._raw_link.close()


class MyConnector:
    async def connect(self, device):
        # Open your own transport here. You can use device.transport_target,
        # or ignore it and use your own connection settings.
        raw_link = await open_my_link(device.transport_target)
        return MyConnection(raw_link, device)


catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()
device = catalog.device_from_profile("x6h")
job = PrintJobBuilder(device).build_from_file("example.png")

connection = await MyConnector().connect(device)
try:
    await connection.send(job)
finally:
    await connection.disconnect()
```

This is the main reason protocol and transport stay separate in the architecture.
The repo should make it easy to reuse protocol logic without forcing one Bluetooth stack.

## Detecting by name is not the same as Bluetooth discovery

There are two different operations in the codebase and they should not be confused.

### `catalog.detect_device(...)`
This does not scan hardware.
It applies detection rules to a known device name and optional address.

Use it when you already have values such as:
- a BLE name from somewhere else
- a saved MAC address
- a stored device config flow that still wants catalog-backed detection

Example:

```python
from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog

catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()
device = catalog.detect_device("MX10-ABCD", "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:59")
if device is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Printer profile not detected")
```

### `BluetoothDiscovery`
This does scan hardware.
It returns real reachable Bluetooth printers as `PrinterDevice` objects.

Use it when your program needs to find printers nearby.

## Save and reload a resolved device config

Use this when you want to inspect or tweak the resolved runtime values instead of relying on auto-detection every time.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog

catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()
device = catalog.detect_device("MX10-ABCD", "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:59")
if device is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Printer profile not detected")

# Export the fully resolved device state.
config = catalog.serialize_device_config(device)
Path("printer.json").write_text(
    json.dumps(config, indent=2, sort_keys=True) + "\n",
    encoding="utf-8",
)

# Load it back later as an explicit PrinterDevice.
loaded = json.loads(Path("printer.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
manual_device = catalog.device_from_config(loaded)
```

This config captures:
- profile
- protocol family
- image pipeline
- runtime variant metadata
- optional transport target

This is the right tool if you want to experiment with runtime values without adding more one-off CLI flags.

## Advanced: build jobs from raster data

Only use this path when you already have raster data and do not want the repo file/rendering pipeline.

Two raster types matter here:

- `RasterBuffer`
  - one raster in one pixel format
  - `pixels` is a flat row-major sequence
  - `width` defines where rows break
- `RasterSet`
  - one or more rasters for the same page, keyed by `PixelFormat`
  - all rasters in the set must have matching dimensions

Supported public pixel formats are:
- `PixelFormat.BW1`
  - binary raster values `0` or `1`
- `PixelFormat.GRAY4`
  - grayscale values `0..15`
- `PixelFormat.GRAY8`
  - grayscale values `0..255`

Most callers do not need to build these manually, because `PrintJobBuilder` and the rendering pipeline already do it.

If you do want the low-level path, it looks like this:

```python
from timiniprint.devices import PrinterCatalog
from timiniprint.protocol import PrinterProtocol
from timiniprint.raster import PixelFormat, RasterBuffer, RasterSet

catalog = PrinterCatalog.load()
device = catalog.detect_device("X6H-ABCD")
if device is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Printer profile not detected")

raster = RasterBuffer(
    pixels=[1] * 64,
    width=8,
    pixel_format=PixelFormat.BW1,
)
raster_set = RasterSet.from_single(raster)

protocol = PrinterProtocol(device)
job = protocol.build_job(
    raster_set,
    is_text=False,
    blackening=3,
    feed_padding=12,
)
```

Use this path when:
- you already have raster data
- you want protocol building without file loading
- you want to plug the built job into your own transport layer

The old function-style raw builders are internal implementation details in `timiniprint.protocol._builders`.
They still exist for internal composition and tests, but they are not the public integration surface anymore.

## Mental model

If you are unsure which API level to use, use this rule:

- `PrintJobBuilder` if you start from a file
- `PrinterProtocol` if you start from raster data
- a connector if you need actual I/O
- `PrinterDevice` as the shared object passed between them

The important thing to avoid is treating `PrinterProtocol` as a connection object.
It is not `Protocol(connector).send(...)`.
Its job is to build a `ProtocolJob` for a specific `PrinterDevice`.

## Where to add new functionality

### Add it to `timiniprint.rendering` when it is about pages or images
Examples:
- a new file loader
- a new page transform
- image preprocessing before rasterization

### Add it to `timiniprint.protocol` when it is about stateless packet building
Examples:
- packet builders
- compression/encoding changes
- family-specific job construction

### Add it to `timiniprint.printing.runtime` when it depends on session state
Examples:
- notify handling
- status polling
- temperature-driven behavior
- stateful BLE write logic

Rule of thumb:
- if it depends only on input data, it belongs in `protocol`
- if it depends on session state, notify packets, timing, or previous writes, it belongs in `printing.runtime`

### Add it to `timiniprint.devices` when it is about describing or detecting printers
Examples:
- profile data models
- profile loading
- detection rules
- `PrinterDevice` creation
- device config serialization

### Add it to `timiniprint.transport` when it is about actual I/O
Examples:
- a new connector
- a new connection implementation
- transport-specific connection or write behavior
